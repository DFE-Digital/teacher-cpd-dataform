# CPD Data README
## Quick Start
### What the project does 

teacher-cpd-dataform is where event data from DfE Teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is streamed to BigQuery using DfE-Digital/dfe-analytics  (https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-analytics).

This event data is then managed by DfE-Digital/dfe-analytics-dataform (https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-analytics-dataform) to create analytics tables for use by the CPD cross-programme data team.  

This Creates a centralised repository for all data relevant to analytics within CPD. This helps with everything from drawing insights across NPQ and ECF to improving the quality of Looker Studio dashboards.
