TAD regularly needs access to the CPD Data Model available in BigQuery. Historically, TAD colleagues accessed data through LookerStudio Dashboards:  
exporting a snapshot of the data from there before uploading it into their R environment. This means of access limited them to snapshots, not a     
continuous stream of data, and meant they had to access the data elsewhere before importing the data into their local environment. 

We upgraded this model, granting individual TAD colleagues access privileges in BigQuery:
  - 'BigQuery Data Editor' - This is granted to a copy of our dataset ensuring they cannot edit our main dataset
  - 'BigQuery Job User' - This gives them billing privileges, it is a requirement to use BigQuery

Using the R Packages 'bigrquery' and 'gargle' they can query BQ directly within their R environment.

This set-up ensures they have up-to-date visibility of the model in their local environment.
